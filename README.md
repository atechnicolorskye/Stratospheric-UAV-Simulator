# Stratospheric-UAV-Simulator
Design of a Stratospheric UAV Simulator

This project enables the user to simulate the flight of an unpowered UAV from altitude which provides a prediction of the landing location of the UAV. The project is packaged as tool with a PyQT GUI and comes with all the required Python dependencies for both OS X and Windows. The parameters needed to start a simulation are all described in the GUI itself. This was my third-year Individual Project for my BEng in Aeronautics and Astronautics at the University of Southampton. Many thanks to Dr Andras Sobester who was my supervisor and Niccolo Zapponi who provided the code to obtain and interpolate GFS weather data.
